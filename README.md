## Published Front End version Alpha Contribution

#### Buruk
Made initial github repository with some tailwind additions
#### Cai
Made the Figma prototype for our application, focused on comparing media and based off of hardware comparison websites.
#### Victor
Look over materials
#### Brittney
Had meetings with Cai and Buruk over some design stuff.
Did spend some time looking over web api credentials because last week seemed to give us some trouble rushing to 
get it in and wanted to make sure things would be working okay for the team who uses our work.
#### Abdullahi
Tested and confirmed the Credentials API works (register, login, JWT, password, email).


### Published Front End version Alpha Meetings
